# Food-Pantry-Inventory

Requirements for a MVP:

1. Keep track of expiration dates, at least to the year, preferably the month/quarter/half-year/etc as well
2. Keep track of location in warehouse (row, bin, tier)
3. Read QR codes that will link to a URL to a website that will work on mobile phones (doesn't need to be a phone app yet)
4. Needs to know products in the boxes, as the boxes should be consistent
5. Have some way of reporting what we need more of for W.A.R.M.


TODO: 

1. Set up Sphinx documentation
2. Try to figure out more steps to put in this todo.
3. At some point will need to figure out how the database will work, whether already provided or will we need to make one?
  3.1. If so, MySQL? Postgress? etc?
